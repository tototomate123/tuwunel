# Policy and Moderation

This chapter covers the federation-level, room-level, and user-level controls
Tuwunel exposes to operators for keeping their server, its users, and the rooms
they participate in within a desired policy posture. Most controls fall into
one of three layers: configuration (statically applied at startup or reload),
admin-room commands (live operator actions), and per-room policy delegation
(MSC4284).

Configuration values shown here are documented in the [example
configuration](./configuration/examples.md#example-configuration) with their
defaults and full per-knob explanation. This page summarises each knob's role
in the moderation toolkit rather than restating the example file.

## Federation server blocklists

The largest hammer. Three knobs in `tuwunel-example.toml`:

- `forbidden_remote_server_names`: regex patterns matched against room IDs,
  room aliases, sender server names, sender users' server names, inbound
  X-Matrix origins, and outbound federation handlers. Effectively a global
  ACL. Matching servers can neither send to nor receive from this homeserver,
  and local clients cannot join their rooms.
- `allowed_remote_server_names_experimental`: an allow-list counterpart. When
  non-empty, anything not matching is denied. `forbidden_remote_server_names`
  is still applied after, so a wide allow (`.*\\.example\\.com`) plus a narrow
  deny (`bad\\.example\\.com`) is a valid composition.
- `forbidden_remote_room_directory_server_names`: limits the broader knob to
  outbound room-directory queries, useful when the goal is to keep users from
  discovering rooms on a server without cutting all federation with it.

These checks are inexpensive and apply on every relevant code path. Use a
regex denylist when a server has crossed a hard line; use the directory-only
variant for cases that warrant friction without isolation.

## Admin commands for moderation

The admin room (joined automatically on first registration unless
`create_admin_room = false`) accepts the following moderation-relevant
commands. Run any command with `--help` for argument detail.

### Rooms

- `!admin rooms moderation ban-room <room>`: bans a room, evicts every local
  user including admins, removes local aliases, unpublishes from the
  directory, and disables federation with the room.
- `!admin rooms moderation ban-list-of-rooms`: bulk variant; takes a code
  block of room IDs or aliases.
- `!admin rooms moderation unban-room <room>`: reverses a ban and re-enables
  federation.
- `!admin rooms moderation list-banned-rooms`: lists every banned room.
- `!admin rooms delete <room>`: harder than ban; removes the room from the
  database after evicting users.

### Federation

- `!admin federation disable-room <room>`: blocks new inbound PDUs for one
  room without banning it. Useful for stalling a runaway room while
  investigating.
- `!admin federation enable-room <room>`: re-enables inbound handling.
- `!admin federation incoming-federation`: lists rooms with active inbound
  PDU handlers.
- `!admin federation fetch-support-well-known <server>`: fetches a remote
  server's `.well-known/matrix/support` record (administrator and security
  contacts), letting you raise abuse reports out-of-band before resorting to
  blocks.

### Users

- `!admin users deactivate <user>`: deactivates a local account; by default
  also leaves all rooms.
- `!admin users deactivate-all`: bulk variant accepting a code block of
  usernames.
- `!admin users reject-invites <user>`: rejects all pending invites, with
  an optional reason. Useful when an account has been targeted by an invite
  flood.
- `!admin users redact-event <event_id>`: forcibly redacts an event from a
  local sender even when the user is offline or unwilling.
- `!admin users force-demote <user> <room>`: drops a user's power level to
  the room default when permissions allow.
- `!admin users set-profile-key <user> <key> <value>`: sets a single profile
  key (e.g. `displayname`, `avatar_url`, `m.tz`, or a custom key) on a local
  user, for example to remove an abusive display name.
- `!admin users delete-room-tag` / `put-room-tag`: room-tag housekeeping;
  the `m.server_notice` tag pinned to the admin room is the typical use.

### Media

See [Multimedia and Storage > Management](./media/management.md) for the full
admin command reference. Tools relevant to moderation:

- `!admin media delete --mxc <mxc_uri>`: single-file removal.
- `!admin media delete-by-event --event-id <event_id>`: removes every MXC
  URI referenced by an event.
- `!admin media delete-list`: bulk removal from a code block of MXC URIs.
- `!admin media delete-range <duration> --older-than|--newer-than`: time-range
  delete; remote-only by default, local with the
  `--yes-i-want-to-delete-local-media` confirmation.
- `!admin media delete-all-from-user <username>`: removes every upload by a
  local user.
- `!admin media delete-all-from-server <server>`: drops every cached copy of
  remote media from the named server.

## Media policy

- `prevent_media_downloads_from`: regex denylist for remote media downloads.
  Narrower than `forbidden_remote_server_names`; the server can still
  federate, just no media flows in.
- `media_storage_provider` (under `[media.storage]`): when files live in an
  external provider, deletion semantics still apply through the same admin
  commands.

## Identifier blocklists

Applied at registration, alias creation, and at startup as warnings against
existing entries.

- `forbidden_alias_names`: regex patterns matched against newly created room
  aliases and custom room IDs. Existing aliases that match are warned about
  on startup but not removed.
- `forbidden_usernames`: same shape, applied to local username availability
  checks and registration.

## Invite gating

- `block_non_admin_invites`: when `true`, only server admins can send room
  invites (local or remote) and only admins can receive remote invites. The
  cheapest mitigation for an invite-spam wave on a small or invite-only
  server.

## Auto-deactivation triggers

- `auto_deactivate_banned_room_attempts`: when `true`, any local user who
  attempts to join a banned room, an alias matching `forbidden_alias_names`,
  or an alias / room ID containing a `forbidden_remote_server_names` match,
  is fully deactivated and made to leave every room. Off by default because
  rooms are sometimes banned for non-moderation reasons.

## Per-room policy delegation (MSC4284)

MSC4284 lets a room's moderators delegate event signing to a third-party
*policy server* whose ed25519 signature must be present on every non-policy
event in the room. The signature folds into `event.signatures` and federates
transitively. Tuwunel implements outbound `/sign` on local sends, inbound
verification on federated receives, fetch-on-missing for inbound events
without a signature, and refusal/backoff caching to avoid hammering a server
that is rate-limiting or has refused.

Two configuration knobs:

- `enable_policy_servers`: master switch (default `false`). When `false`,
  Tuwunel ignores policy state entirely. When `true`, the gate engages only
  in rooms that carry a valid `m.room.policy` state event.
- `policy_server_request_timeout`: seconds (default `5`) for both outbound
  `/sign` and inbound signature-fetch requests.

Operator-relevant implications when enabling:

- **Per-room opt-in.** The global flag only allows the gate to engage; the
  room's own `m.room.policy` state event is what activates it. Rooms without
  the state event are unaffected.
- **Latency cost.** Every outbound send in a policy-room round-trips to the
  policy server before federating. The default 5-second cap prevents a
  single misbehaving policy server from stalling sends indefinitely.
- **Fail-open on transport failure.** Network errors and timeouts are logged
  and the event is sent or accepted unsigned, on the assumption that the
  next homeserver in the room will pick up the gap.
- **Fail-closed on explicit refusal.** A policy server returning
  `400 M_FORBIDDEN` (or, on the unstable variant, `200 OK` with no signature
  for the configured `via`) causes outbound sends to fail with `M_FORBIDDEN`,
  and inbound events to soft-fail.
- **Inbound soft-fails withhold the event, and are reversible.** A soft-failed
  event is kept out of the room timeline and is never relayed to clients, but
  it stays stored, still answers federation requests for it, and still carries
  the state that descendant events resolve against. The verdict is re-checked
  whenever federation supplies the event again, on a schedule that widens from
  five minutes to a day. An explicit refusal is itself cached for 24 hours, so
  re-checks inside that window answer from the cache and the policy server is
  only asked again once it lapses; `!admin rooms clear-soft-failed-events
  <room>` drops the stored verdicts for one room to force the question
  immediately.
- **Soft-failed events do not move the room forward.** They are not added to
  the room's forward extremities and do not resolve into current state, so a
  refused membership or power-level change cannot take effect locally.
- **Privacy in encrypted rooms.** The PDU is forwarded to the policy server
  for signing. Ciphertext is opaque, but metadata (sender, timestamp, room,
  event type) is not. Encrypted-room policy delegation is the room's call;
  Tuwunel does not block it.
- **Refusal and rate-limit caching.** Per-event refusals and
  `M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` backoffs are persisted, so repeated arrivals of the same
  event do not re-hit a refusing or throttled server.

For room version compatibility, MSC4416 (the room-version-13 successor that
makes a missing or invalid policy signature an auth-rule rejection rather
than a soft fail) is not yet active in Tuwunel and depends on upstream
typing work. Until v13 ships, "leave it off" is safe; once v13 rooms become
common, leaving it off in such a room means accepting events that the rest
of the federation will reject.

## URL previews and outbound network policy

URL preview generation is a frequent attack surface (SSRF, exfiltration via
forced fetches). Tuwunel exposes both a domain policy layer and an IP egress
layer.

Domain policy:

- `url_preview_domain_contains_allowlist`, `url_preview_url_contains_allowlist`:
  permissive contains-match allowlists. The contains-match is intentionally
  loose; treat as "anything mentioning this string passes".
- `url_preview_domain_explicit_allowlist`: strict equality match on the host.
- `url_preview_domain_explicit_denylist`: strict equality match, evaluated
  before the allowlist.
- `url_preview_check_root_domain`: when `true`, applies the contains and
  explicit allowlists against the root domain, so an allow on `wikipedia.org`
  also lets `en.m.wikipedia.org` through.
- `url_preview_max_spider_size` (bytes; SI/IEC suffix accepted): caps the
  spider response body.
- `url_preview_bound_interface`: pins outbound preview requests to a specific
  interface or source IP. Linux/Android/Fuchsia accept interface names
  (`eth0`); other platforms accept addresses.

IP egress:

- `ip_range_denylist`: list of IPv4/IPv6 CIDR ranges Tuwunel will not send
  outbound requests to. Defaults to RFC1918, loopback, multicast, link-local,
  and the documentation/testnet ranges. This is application-layer enforcement
  and not a substitute for a host firewall, but it closes the obvious SSRF
  vectors out of the box. Set to `[]` only if a firewall is enforcing the
  same constraints upstream.

## Redaction retention and forensics

Moderation actions often hinge on what an event said before redaction.

- `save_unredacted_events` (default `true`): keeps the pre-redaction PDU in
  storage so admins can recover content for incident review.
- `redaction_retention_seconds` (default 60 days): how long unredacted copies
  live before being dropped. Lower this for tighter privacy posture; raise
  it when investigations span longer horizons.
- `allow_room_admins_to_request_unredacted_events` (default `true`): lets a
  user with `redact` power level retrieve unredacted copies via MSC2815.
  Server admins can request regardless.
- `disable_local_redactions`: blocks local users from sending redactions
  (server admins exempt). Useful only in archival or read-only deployments;
  most operators leave this off.

The `!admin debug get-retained-pdu` command surfaces a retained event from
the admin room.

## Responding to a spam incident

When a server sends spam media to your users, the typical response is:

**1. Identify the source server.**
Check the MXC URIs in the reported messages. The server name is the
authority component: `mxc://<server_name>/<media_id>`. The sender server
on the offending event is the canonical source even when media is hosted
elsewhere.

**2. Delete cached copies of the spam media.**

```
!admin media delete-all-from-server badserver.tld
```

**3. Block future media downloads from that server.**
Add the server to `prevent_media_downloads_from` in your config and reload
or restart Tuwunel:

```toml
prevent_media_downloads_from = ["badserver\\.tld$"]
```

**4. If the spam arrived within a known time window**, use `delete-range` to
catch anything missed:

```
!admin media delete-range 2h --newer-than
```

**5. If you have a list of specific MXC URIs** (e.g. from a moderation tool
or a shared blocklist), use `delete-list` to remove them in bulk.

**6. Consider server-level federation blocks** via
`forbidden_remote_server_names` if the server is persistently abusive. This
blocks all federation traffic, not just media, and so is the right tool only
once the source has demonstrated it will not stop.

**7. If the spam came as invite floods**, set `block_non_admin_invites = true`
to halt all non-admin invite traffic during the incident, then run
`!admin users reject-invites <user>` for affected accounts. Re-enable invites
once the source server is blocked.

**8. If a single room is the vector** (for example, a public room being used
to flood a user's timeline), `!admin rooms moderation ban-room <room>` evicts
your local users and severs federation with the room without affecting
other rooms on the same server.

**9. For ongoing moderation against a class of senders**, consider whether
a per-room MSC4284 policy server is appropriate. This delegates per-event
signing to a moderation service, with the trade-offs described in
[Per-room policy delegation](#per-room-policy-delegation-msc4284) above.
This is a heavier setup than a one-time response and is worth it only when
the room expects sustained policy enforcement.
