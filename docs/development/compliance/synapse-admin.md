# Synapse Admin API

Tuwunel serves the Synapse administration API under the `/_synapse/admin` path so that existing Matrix server administration tools work against it, including administration dashboards such as synapse-admin and ketesa and moderation bots such as Draupnir and Meowlnir.

This page lists every `/_synapse/admin` endpoint Tuwunel is aware of and whether it is served. Endpoints that are not served return `404 M_UNRECOGNIZED`. All endpoints require an administrator access token unless the description says otherwise.

## Status

- ✅ **supported**: implemented and served today.
- 🟨 **planned**: on the current implementation roadmap; not yet served.
- 🟥 **not-implemented**: a supportable endpoint that Tuwunel does not serve yet, deferred pending new storage or a subsystem and not on the current roadmap.
- ⬛ **not-applicable**: does not apply to Tuwunel's storage engine or data model, or is intentionally omitted.

## Counts

- Endpoints (method and path): 100
  - ✅ supported: 69
  - 🟨 planned: 1
  - 🟥 not-implemented: 22
  - ⬛ not-applicable: 8
