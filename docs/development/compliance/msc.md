# Tuwunel MSC Implementation Status

## Columns

- **Inv**: inventory status (matrix-spec-proposals state). One of
  `merged`, `open`, `closed`, `unknown`.
- **Status**: ✅ `yes` / 🟨 `partial` / ❌ `no` / ⬛ `n/a`,
  followed by a confidence glyph (● high / ◐ med / ○ low /
  · unknown) that reflects confidence in the assessment, not
  in the implementation.
- **Correct/Impl**: two absolute percentages of the total proposal,
  e.g. `70/80`. Correct is the share of the proposal's requirements
  Tuwunel adheres to correctly; Impl is the share that has any code
  path attempting adherence. By definition Correct <= Impl. Either
  may be `?`. Proposals are loosely normative, so this is NOT just
  MUST/SHOULD: every requirement-shaped statement counts ("the server
  returns X", "this field is added to Y", etc.).

## Counts

- ✅ `yes`: 257
- 🟨 `partial`: 34
- ❌ `no`: 447
- ⬛ `n/a`: 286

MSCs marked `n/a`: out of scope for a homeserver (3PID-only,
identity-server-only, integration-manager-only, widget/client-only,
governance/process, or superseded by another MSC). Listed here for
audit; the `Inv` column carries each row's inventory bucket in
