# Matrix Authentication Service (MAS)

Tuwunel can integrate with MAS in two independent directions:

- For login, Tuwunel acts as an OAuth client and MAS is an upstream OpenID
  Connect identity provider.
- For provisioning, MAS acts as a client of Tuwunel's private compatibility API
  and manages Matrix users, profiles, and devices. It can also authorize
  cross-signing key replacement.

They can be enabled independently or together. Each direction has its own
credential: the OAuth client secret authenticates Tuwunel to MAS, while
`mas_secret` authenticates MAS to Tuwunel. Generate separate, high-entropy
values for them.

## Integration model

Tuwunel remains the issuer that Matrix clients use for next-generation
authentication. Its built-in [OIDC Authorization Server](../oidc-server.md)
redirects users to MAS for authentication, then Tuwunel issues the tokens its
clients use.

This differs from MAS's delegated-authentication topology with Synapse. In
particular:

- MAS access tokens cannot be used directly against Tuwunel. Point clients at
  Tuwunel's issuer, not MAS's issuer.
- `mas_secret` does not delegate login or token issuance. It authorizes MAS to
  call Tuwunel's private provisioning API and changes which Synapse-compatible
  account administration routes Tuwunel serves.

Logging in through MAS therefore always requires a
`[[global.identity_provider]]` entry, whether or not provisioning is enabled.

## Configure MAS as a login provider

### Register Tuwunel in MAS

Add a confidential OAuth client to the MAS configuration:

```yaml
clients:
  - client_id: 01J44Q10GR4AMTFZEEF936DTCM
    client_auth_method: client_secret_post
    client_secret: <oauth_client_secret>
    redirect_uris:
      - https://matrix.example.com/_matrix/client/unstable/login/sso/callback/01J44Q10GR4AMTFZEEF936DTCM
```

MAS requires a statically configured `client_id` to be a ULID, which is 26
characters of Crockford base32. Use the same value for MAS's `client_id`,
Tuwunel's `client_id`, and the final path segment of the callback URL.

The redirect URI must match exactly. `client_secret_post` is required for this
integration because Tuwunel sends the client ID and secret in the form-encoded
token request body. MAS supports either `client_secret` or `client_secret_file`.
See the upstream [MAS client configuration](https://element-hq.github.io/matrix-authentication-service/reference/configuration.html#clients)
for the complete client schema.

### Configure Tuwunel

```toml
[[global.identity_provider]]
brand = "MAS"
client_id = "01J44Q10GR4AMTFZEEF936DTCM"
client_secret = "<oauth_client_secret>"
issuer_url = "https://auth.example.com"
callback_url = "https://matrix.example.com/_matrix/client/unstable/login/sso/callback/01J44Q10GR4AMTFZEEF936DTCM"
scope = ["openid"]
```

The `issuer_url` must exactly match the `issuer` value returned by MAS's
`/.well-known/openid-configuration`. This may differ from MAS's
`http.public_base` when a separate `http.issuer` is configured. The MAS HTTP
listener must serve both its `discovery` and `oauth` resources.

Leave `authorization_url` unset. It overrides the authorization endpoint, not
the provider's base address. OIDC discovery fills it from MAS's discovery
document. Setting it to the MAS root sends users to the account-management page
instead of starting an authorization flow.

### Scopes and user information

Current MAS discovery advertises the standard `openid` and `email` scopes, but
not `profile`. Its userinfo endpoint requires `openid` and returns `sub` and
`username`, which is all Tuwunel needs for this login flow.

Tuwunel 1.8.3 defaults an empty `scope` to `["openid"]` when
`brand = "MAS"`. Keeping it explicit also makes the configuration work with
Tuwunel 1.8.2 and earlier, whose default included `profile` and was rejected by
MAS.

## Optional user and device provisioning

MAS can manage its Tuwunel users through the private `/_synapse/mas/*` API.
This is separate from using MAS as an upstream login provider. Login does not
use these routes, and provisioning does not make MAS Tuwunel's token issuer.

Add a high-entropy shared secret to Tuwunel:

```toml
[global]
mas_secret = "<provisioning_secret>"
```

Configure MAS to reach Tuwunel with the same secret:

```yaml
matrix:
  kind: synapse
  homeserver: example.com
  endpoint: "https://matrix.example.com"
  secret: "<provisioning_secret>"
```

Set `homeserver` to Tuwunel's `server_name`. Set `endpoint` to the base URL that
MAS can use to reach Tuwunel. MAS also accepts `secret_file` instead of an inline
secret. See the upstream [MAS homeserver configuration](https://element-hq.github.io/matrix-authentication-service/reference/configuration.html#matrix)
for the full `matrix` schema.

MAS currently documents Synapse as its supported homeserver backend. Use
`kind: synapse` with Tuwunel because Tuwunel implements the same modern private
API that MAS uses for Synapse. Do not add Synapse's
`matrix_authentication_service` configuration to Tuwunel. Tuwunel does not ask
MAS to introspect client access tokens.

If MAS connects through a reverse proxy, forward `/_synapse/mas/*` to Tuwunel.
It is preferable to use a private network path when one is available. Every
request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <provisioning_secret>`; a missing or
incorrect secret receives `403 Forbidden`.

Treat `mas_secret` as an administrator credential. It authorizes MAS to create,
update, lock, unlock, deactivate, reactivate, and erase users; replace verified
email bindings; change profiles; create, rename, delete, and reconcile devices;
and grant bounded authorization for cross-signing key replacement. Keep the API
on a restricted network path where possible and replace the secret if it is
disclosed. The routes remain registered when `mas_secret` is unset, but every
request to them receives `403 Forbidden`.

Provisioning jobs also require a MAS worker. The normal `mas-cli server` command
starts one. Deployments that run the MAS HTTP service without its bundled worker
must run a separate `mas-cli worker` process. See the upstream
[MAS running guide](https://element-hq.github.io/matrix-authentication-service/setup/running.html)
for its process model.

### Provisioning API surface

Tuwunel implements all twelve routes used by MAS's modern homeserver client:

- User lifecycle: `GET /_synapse/mas/is_localpart_available`,
  `POST /_synapse/mas/provision_user`, `GET /_synapse/mas/query_user`,
  `POST /_synapse/mas/delete_user`, and
  `POST /_synapse/mas/reactivate_user`.
- Profiles: `POST /_synapse/mas/set_displayname` and
  `POST /_synapse/mas/unset_displayname`.
- Devices: `POST /_synapse/mas/upsert_device`,
  `POST /_synapse/mas/delete_device`,
  `POST /_synapse/mas/update_device_display_name`, and
  `POST /_synapse/mas/sync_devices`.
- Cross-signing: `POST /_synapse/mas/allow_cross_signing_reset`.

These are unversioned implementation endpoints intended only for MAS. Setting
`mas_secret` also removes selected Synapse-compatible account administration
routes that conflict with MAS ownership, matching Synapse's delegated-auth
behavior. See the [Synapse Admin API](../../development/compliance/synapse-admin.md)
page for the affected routes. Only set it when MAS will manage accounts on this
server.

Changing one nonempty `mas_secret` to another takes effect on configuration
reload. Enabling or disabling MAS by crossing between an empty and nonempty
value requires a restart so Tuwunel can rebuild the set of account
administration routes it serves.

## Match MAS-provisioned users

Ensure the MAS worker finishes provisioning each account before that user's
first SSO login. Configure the same self-hosted MAS identity provider as trusted
so its `username` claim can match the existing account:

```toml
trusted = true
userid_claims = ["username"]
```

Only enable trusted mode when `issuer_url` names the same MAS instance that
provisions this server and you operate and fully control it. A trusted provider
can authenticate as any existing Matrix account whose localpart matches a
returned username. The `brand` value selects MAS-specific defaults; it does not
establish trust or link the provider to `mas_secret`.

Do not include `"sub"` in `userid_claims` for this topology. Tuwunel gives it
precedence over `username`, while MAS provisions accounts by localpart. Leaving
`userid_claims` empty also works because Tuwunel considers `username` by
default, but setting it explicitly avoids an accidental future claim mismatch.

If every account must be provisioned by MAS before login, also set:

```toml
registration = false
```

This makes an SSO login fail instead of creating an account when provisioning
has not completed. It only controls registration through this identity
provider. Keep the global `allow_registration` setting disabled as well if every
account creation path must go through MAS. If the provider cannot be trusted,
use an
[admin-approved association](../providers.md#admin-approved-association-for-untrusted-providers)
for each existing user instead.

## Environment variables

The equivalent Tuwunel environment variables are:

```env
TUWUNEL_IDENTITY_PROVIDER__0__BRAND="mas"
TUWUNEL_IDENTITY_PROVIDER__0__CLIENT_ID="01J44Q10GR4AMTFZEEF936DTCM"
TUWUNEL_IDENTITY_PROVIDER__0__CLIENT_SECRET="<oauth_client_secret>"
TUWUNEL_IDENTITY_PROVIDER__0__ISSUER_URL="https://auth.example.com"
TUWUNEL_IDENTITY_PROVIDER__0__CALLBACK_URL="https://matrix.example.com/_matrix/client/unstable/login/sso/callback/01J44Q10GR4AMTFZEEF936DTCM"
TUWUNEL_IDENTITY_PROVIDER__0__SCOPE='["openid"]'
TUWUNEL_MAS_SECRET="<provisioning_secret>"
TUWUNEL_IDENTITY_PROVIDER__0__TRUSTED="true"
TUWUNEL_IDENTITY_PROVIDER__0__USERID_CLAIMS='["username"]'
```

For strict pre-provisioning, also set
`TUWUNEL_IDENTITY_PROVIDER__0__REGISTRATION="false"`. For login without
provisioning, omit `TUWUNEL_MAS_SECRET`. Choose `TRUSTED` and `USERID_CLAIMS`
according to the account-matching policy described above.

## Troubleshooting

- If the browser stops on the MAS account page, remove `authorization_url` and
  let discovery provide the authorization endpoint.
- If MAS reports that `profile` is not allowed, request only `openid`.
- If provisioning calls receive `403 Forbidden`, verify that MAS and Tuwunel
  use the same nonempty provisioning secret and that the request reaches
  Tuwunel's `/_synapse/mas/*` routes.
- If a provisioned user receives a separate account after SSO, verify
  `trusted = true`, `userid_claims = ["username"]`, and that MAS returns the
  provisioned localpart as `username`.
- If MAS never sends provisioning calls, verify that a MAS worker is running.
