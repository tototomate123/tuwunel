# Tuwunel for Kubernetes

Tuwunel doesn't support horizontal scalability or distributed loading
natively, however a community maintained Helm Chart is available here to run
Tuwunel on Kubernetes: <https://github.com/AreYouLoco/tuwunel-helm> and the
legacy conduwuit version: <https://gitlab.cronce.io/charts/conduwuit>.

Should changes need to be made, please reach out to the maintainer in our
Matrix room as this is not maintained/controlled by the Tuwunel maintainers.
