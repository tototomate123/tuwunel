//! RocksDB engine: database-wide operations and shared resources.
//!
//! `Engine` owns the opened RocksDB instance together with the worker pool, the
//! shared open-time context, and the flags fixed at open (read-only, secondary,
//! checksums). Per-column-family reads and writes go through `Map`; the methods
//! here act on the database as a whole: WAL flush and sync, memtable flush,
//! manual compaction and primary catch-up, property queries, and the cork
//! counter that coalesces WAL writes (see the `cork` module).
