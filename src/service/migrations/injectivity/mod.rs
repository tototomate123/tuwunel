//! Short id injectivity: the one-time scan and repair.
//!
//! Releases before v1.8.3 could mint two short ids for one identity,
//! leaving stale reverse rows in both families, ghost entries in a few
//! compressed states, and auth chains cached from both allocations. The
//! migration measures that residue, repairs what matches the shapes it
//! handles, and marks itself complete like any other. Every release
//! through v1.8.3 also memoized auth chains truncated at a missing
//! ancestor, which no scan tells from a whole one, so the cache is
//! discarded once on a marker of its own.
