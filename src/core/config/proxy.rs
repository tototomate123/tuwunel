//! Defines outbound proxy configuration and domain matching.
//!
//! The module supports no proxy, one global proxy, or domain-specific include
//! and exclude rules. URL matching selects the applicable proxy at request
//! time.

/// ## Examples:
/// - No proxy (default):
/// ```toml
/// proxy ="none"
/// ```
/// - Global proxy
/// ```toml
/// [global.proxy]
/// global = { url = "socks5h://localhost:9050" }
/// ```
/// - Proxy some domains
/// ```toml
/// [global.proxy]
/// [[global.proxy.by_domain]]
/// url = "socks5h://localhost:9050"
/// include = ["*.onion", "matrix.myspecial.onion"]
/// exclude = ["*.myspecial.onion"]
/// ```
/// ## Include vs. Exclude
/// If include is an empty list, it is assumed to be `["*"]`.
///
/// If a domain matches both the exclude and include list, the proxy will only
/// be used if it was included because of a more specific rule than it was
/// excluded. In the above example, the proxy would be used for
/// `ordinary.onion`, `matrix.myspecial.onion`, but not `hello.myspecial.onion`.
